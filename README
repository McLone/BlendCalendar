BlendCalendar provides an extended time/date data type that allows for the 
handling of recurring events. 

This extension adds a new datatype, a new fetch, admin templates to provide an 
AJAX-based calendar control, and some supporting components.

WARNING : this branch has a different data structure from the orignal branch
